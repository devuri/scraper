# Web to Sheets Scraper

## This project is designed to updated a google sheets with data from a website.
*I'm using this to explore [Google's PHP API client](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/php) and the [DOMXPath class](http://php.net/manual/en/class.domxpath.php) class in PHP.*

### Background
I use google docs to manage some golf pools. It can be tough to update all the scores of a few players throughout a tournament. Using [ESPN's leaderboard](http://www.espn.com/golf/leaderboard), I designed this project to easily pull in up-to-date scores for a handful of golfers into a google sheet.
